Adults in Georgia attain a body length of 86 mm in males and 87 mm in females while those in the north reach 103 mm in males and 105 mm in females. There is a similar clinal increase in body size from low to high altitudes. Dorsal coloration varies extensively, from brown, bronze, or olive to green, bicolor or bluish. The dorsum may have spots, blotches, or vermiculations of dark pigment, but such markings are not present on all individuals. The dorsolateral folds are distinct. Venter is white, sometimes with gray mottling on the throat, jaw margin and hind limbs. The outer surface of the limbs is barred or nearly so. The side of the face is colored bronze or green. There is no light line present on the upper jaw. Toes are webbed extensively, but not to the tips of digits III,IV,V. In males the tympanum is larger than the eye, the thumb and forelimb are enlarged, and the lateral vocal sacs are not externally visible. The skin of northern males is slightly rough and the throat is yellow. </p><p> <i>R. c. clamitans</i> and <i>R. c. melanota</i> are subspecies.</p><p><a href=javascript:openNewWindow('http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/wss&CISOPTR=959&CISOBOX=1&REC=1')><img align=\"top\" src=\"http://amphibiaweb.org/images/sound3.gif\"> Hear calls at the Western Sound Archive.</a></p>","agents":[{"full_name":"April Robinson","homepage":"","role":"author"},{"full_name":"AmphibiaWeb","homepage":"http://amphibiaweb.org/","role":"provider"}],"references":["Stewart, M.

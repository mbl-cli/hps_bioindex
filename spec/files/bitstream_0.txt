INTRODUCTION
 Subscribers are herewith receiving the supplement to the seventh issue.
 On March 20''^, 1958 the General Embryological Information Service was
 established as a private Foundation. The Board of the Foundation is constituted
 as follows:
 Prof. Dr. Chr. P. Raven, Utrecht, President
 J. H. des Tombe, Mr., Utrecht, Secretary-treasurer
 Dr. P. D. Nieuwkoop, Utrecht, Member
 Prof. Dr. P. J. Gaillard, Leiden, Member
 Prof. Dr. M. W. Woerdeman, Amsterdam, Member
 Correspondence concerning editorial and administrative matters should
 henceforth be directed to Mr. J. Faber, Hubrecht Laboratory, Utrecht.
 Since 1950, the year in which the present subscription price was fixed, the
 coverage and size of the periodical have increased considerably. The number of
 collaborators has increased by about 50 %, the number of co-operating institutes
 by about 75 %, and the number of pages (free supplement included) by about
 50 %. Moreover a number of new chapters were opened during this period.
 An increase in price has therefore become inevitable. Starting with the eighth
 full issue (1959), the subscription price has been fixed at H.fl. 28.50 (i.e.
 $7.50).
 Information regarding the international team work project of the Hubrecht
 Laboratory will be found in the section "Communications from the Hubrecht
 Laboratory" on page 15

 Communications from ifie HubrecLt LaLoratory
 I The Hubrecht Laboratory
 From March 15"^ till August 31^', 1958, the third international team work on
 embryology was held in Utrecht under the joint direction of Prof. Dr. Chr. P.
 Raven (University of Utrecht) and Dr. P. D. Nieuwkoop (Director of the
 Hubrecht Laboratory). The topic of this team work was: "A morphological
 and physiological analysis of regulative and non-regulative processes in the
 development o[ "mosaic" eggs o[ several terrestrial and freshwater inverte-
 brates".
 The team consisted of seven members from five countries of four continents,
 viz.:
 Miss A. Andrew, M.Sc, Johannesburg, South Africa
 Dr. J. C. George, Baroda, India
 Dr. C. Jura. Krakow, Poland
 Dr. J. B. Morrill, Tallahassee, Flor., U.S.A.
 Dr. I. Nakamura, Tokyo. Japan
 Dr. S. Seo, Fukuoka, Japan
 Mr. E. Suminski, M.V.Sc, Warszawa, Poland
 Both scientifically and socially the team work has been very successful.
 A number of separate publications will be prepared by individual members.
 The space available for guest-workers in the present building is rapidly
 diminishing, mainly because of the expanding international activities of the
 Laboratory and the concomitant extension of its staff. At present plans are
 being developed for the erection of a new building. This project is taking
 much of the time of the scientific staff. Both these factors make it unavoidable
 to postpone the fourth international team work. As soon as a decision can be
 taken regarding this point, a proper announcement will be made.

 The Bonrd of the I. I.E. is constituted as follows:
 Prof. Dr. A. M. Dalcq, President (member of the Board since 1948)
 Prof. Dr. F. E. Lehniann. Secretary-treasurer (1949)
 Prof. Dr. P. A. Weiss, Vice President (1949)

 Dr. H. B. Fell. Member (1952)
 Prof. Dr. S. Horstadius. Member (1956)
 Dr. P. D. Nieuwkoop, Adjunct Secretary-treasurer
 The next General Assembly will be held at Pallanza, Italy, at the end of
 August or the middle of September. 1960. along with a Symposium (see
 below). New fellows and members will be elected at the General Assembly.
 Information as to the election of new members, as well as the latest list of
 Fellows and Members, may be found in the seventh issue, 1957, p. 207—210.
 In 1960 a Symposium will be held under the title: "Recent advances (since
 19-i5) in our knowledge of germ cells and earliest stages of development".
 Participation will probably be on the basis of introduction by fellows or mem-
 bers. Most of the contributions will be of a comparative and synthetic nature.
 The best possible chances will be given to young scientists, who have derived
 some reputation from recent original achievements.
 There will be no division into sections. The tentative programme reads as
 follows:
 1st Part: Formation, ultra-structure and physiology of oocytes, as seen in
 the light of their morphogenetical significance (a) relations with the maternal
 organism, b) progressive changes in structural and biochemical composition,
 c) polarity and bilateral symmetry, d) nucleo-cytoplasmic relations, etc.).
 As an addition, two supplementary evening lectures may be planned, dealing
 respectively with the ultra-structure of the sperm cell, and with the biochem-
 istry and physiology of the male gamete.
 2nd Part: Progressii^e maturation of the organization pattern in fertilized
 and cleaving eggs (structure and biochemistry, type of cleavage, development
 of symmetry, role of the nucleus, changes in the cortex, significance of the
 respective blastomeres. topogcnesis and topochemistry, early development of
 enzyme systems).
 Division to be made partly according to taxonomic groups, partly according
 to more general themes.
 Separate reports are expected on: a) Spiralia, b) Arthropodes, c) Echino-
 derms. d) Ascidians, e) development of symmetry in Vertebrates, f) role of
 the nucleus, g) topogenesis and topochemistry, h) early development of
 enzyme systems, i) Mammalia.

 In accordance with point b. 3 of the previous communications (see seventh
 full issue, 1957), an advisory committee, consisting of the President, the
 Secretary and one of the Vice Presidents, paid a visit to the Hubrecht Labor-
 atory on the 19th of September. 1958. The visitors were received by Prof.
 Raven, President of the Board of Control of the Royal Dutch Academy of
 Sciences, and by Dr. Nieuwkoop, Director. The latter communicated about the
 new building project, the General Embryological Information Service, the
 Central Embryological Library and the Central Embryological Collection, and
 about the scientific work of the staff of the Institute and that of the third inter-
 national team. Prof. Raven commented more in detail upon the latter subject.

 "INTRODUCTION TO GENERAL EMBRYOLOGY"
 1957
 by A. M. Dalcq Clarendon Press:
 (translated by Jean Medawar) O.xford Univ. Press
 177 pp. with 55 figs. Price: 25 s.
 This little book is a rearrangement and enlargement of material from a series
 of broadcast talks. It is essentially selective and panoramic; much weight is
19
 given to theoretical aspects, and less to facts. Considerable space has been
 allotted to the discussion of some of the author's own contributions to the
 science of embryology, and to their theoretical interpretations in particular.
 The author's approach is many-sided, covering morphological, evolutionary,
 genetical, cytological and cytochemical aspects of animal development.
 It is difficult to say which category of readers will benefit most by this book.
 It is certainly not a book for undergraduate students, although the title might
 at first suggest this. Several chapters will be read with interest by active
 embryologists, but as a whole it seems best suited for postgraduate students
 who want a stimulating introductory text, not burdened by too much factual
 information.
 "GRUNDRISS DER ENTWICKLUNGSGESCHICHTE

 3^d edition, 1958
 by H. Ferner Ernst Reinhardt Verlag
 163 pp. with 86 figs Munchen/Basel
 (paper bound) Price: D.M. 4.90
 .This is a concise and inexpensive booklet designed for the use of medical
 students. The first edition appeared in 1949. The typography is clear. The
 illustrations are well-executed line-drawings, mostly redrawn after well-known
 examples. There is an alphabetical index, but no bibliography, and no
 literature-references are given in the text.
 "FOUNDATIONS OF EMBRYOLOGY"
 1958

 578 pp. with 962 ill. New York, London, Toronto
 grouped as 313 figs., Price: 74 s.
 of which 24 in colour
 This book has been written for the use of students who have no previous
 knowledge of embryology. Its aim is to tell the story of vertebrate development
 as simply and clearly as possible, but with a very generous use of illustrations.
 The early stages until formation of the germ layers are based on a wide
 range of animal groups, the laying down of the basic plan of the body is based
 on the chick, and organogenesis on mammalian embryos. Stress is placed on
 the basic similarity of the major developmental processes in the vertebrates as
 a whole and on functional aspects. Comparative and experimental data are
 used only in a supplementary way.
 An important aspect of the book is an appendix containing references for
 collateral reading. It has been composed especially for the interested student,
 and contains provocative but not too difficult articles, taken from readily
 available journals in the English language.
 For those who know the author's previous books it is not necessary to say
 that the illustrations of this book are again excellent. Where necessary they
 bear extensive explanatory legends.

 This laboratory manual is entirely adapted to a particular type of practical
 course for zoology students. The underlying idea is that comparative anatomy
 and embryology of the vertebrates should be and can be taught in one inte-
 grated course, an idea which is being brought into practice in some Zoology
 Departments in the U.S.A. today.
 The course opens with an introduction into basic vertebrate organization
 based on Ammocoetes. Then follow cleavage, gastrulation and neurulation in
 Amphioxus and the frog, and early embryogeny of the chick. After the extra-
 embryonic membranes have been dealt with, the further treatment is by organ
 systems. In each of these, anatomy and embrology are treated in a single
 sequence. For reasons of time-saving certain organs such as the skin and the
 musculature have been left out of consideration altogether, a feature which
 reduces the usefulness of the book in those instances where time is more
 abundant.
 The species used are: shark, Amia, Necturus, chick, cat, pig and others.
 Very good, well-selected line drawings and diagrams serve as illustrations.
 THE EVOLUTION OF DEVELOPMENT"
 1958
 by J. T. Bonner Cambridge Univ. Press
 103 pp. with 33 figs. Price: 17 s. 6 d.
 The three chapters of this little book represent three special lectures given
 by the author at University College, London. The nature of the contents of
 the book is largely theoretical and speculative, and its purpose is to be thought-
 provoking, and to provide a wider view of development.
 The first chapter ("The origin of development") deals essentially with the
 question of what necessitated the appearance of the phenomenon of develop-
 ment from unicellularity to multicellularity during evolution, and in which
 different ways this end was achieved. The importance of size, variability, and
 reproduction by small units is considered in the light of natural selection.
21
 In the second chapter ("The function of development") attention is focused
 on the processes leading from the small reproductive units to well-adapted,
 relatively large individual organisms possessing division of labour among their
 cells. Different patterning mechanisms play a role here, involving close co-
 ordination between the parts. Parallels are drawn between many different
 types of development, and their possible evolution is discussed.
 In the last chapter ("The extension of development") the major character-
 istic of development, integration along with increase in size, is extended into
 the domain of associations of individuals, and the adaptive value it has also in
 this domain is stressed. Again a variety of examples are given, illustrating the
 particular mechanisms of co-ordination prevailing here. Among these examples
 are symbiosis, fertilization, mating in lower organisms, and social behaviour in
 animals. Here the author obviously exceeds the limits of what is usually meant
 by the word "development".
 "METHODS FOR OBTAINING AND HANDLING MARINE EGGS
 AND EMBRYOS"
 1957
 by D. P. Costello, M. E. Davidson, Marine Biological Laboratory
 A. Eggers, M. H. Fox and C. Henley Woods Hole, Mass.
 247 pp. , Price: $ 3.50 in the U.S.A.
 $ 4.00 elsewhere
 This manual compiles all the known methods for handling embryological
 material available at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Mass.
 The information is of course also useful for investigators working at other
 localities and with related forms not listed in the book.
 There is a short introductory chapter on general methods. The actual list
 of specific methods is arranged in a taxonomic order, starting with the Porifera
 and ending with the Teleosts. The total number of species hsted is 94. For
 each species the data are arranged conveniently under a number of sub-
 headings, and are followed by a list of references of work on the species,
 which, although it is not complete, includes the most important relevant titles.
 Moreover the book contains a most useful table summarizing the egg
 characteristics of all the species (e.g. egg size, stage of nucleus at time of
 fertilization, rate of development, jelly, secondary membranes). An alphabetical
 index concludes the book.
 "STUDIES ON THE PASSAGE OF PHOSPHATE BETWEEN
 MOTHER AND FOETUS IN THE GUINEA PIG"
 1957
 by F. Fuchs Ejnar Munksgaard
 127 pp. Copenhagen
 Price: D.Kr. 20.00
 This is a doctor's thesis, the work for which was carried out partly at the
 Department of Embryology, Carnegie Institution of Washington, and partly
 at the Department of Medical Physiology, University of Copenhagen. The
 study was performed with the aid of radioactive phosphorus.

 aus dem Gebiet der normalen und
 pathologischen Anatomie)
 Price: D.M. 33.—
 This monograph presents a thorough ticatment of the very complex problems
 connected with normal and abnormal development of the heart and the large
 blood vessels of the thora.x. A special section is devoted to the phylogenesis
 of heart development. The different categories of malformations are treated in
 connection with the developmental periods in which they originate.
 The emphasis throughout is on functional and dynamic aspects. The heart is
 considered and treated as a unity, especially in the early stages. Extensive
 theoretical considerations are supplemented by the author's own findings on
 21 malformed hearts. The book is illustrated with many photographs of
 abnormal hearts, and a large number of very clear diagrammatic drawings
 and schemes. There is an extensive bibliography, and author and subject
 indexes.
 "PHYSIOLOGY OF PREMATURITY"
 Conference Transactions, 1956 (issued 1957)
 1^* Conference The Josiah Macy,
 edited by J. T. Lanman Jr. Foundation
 151 pp. with 42 figs. New York
 Price: $3.25
 This is a conference report similar to those on "Gestation" announced in
 the seventh full issue (p. 216). The present report consists of extensive group
 discussions on "fetal-maternal endocrinology in late pregnancy" and "the
 fetal and placental circulation in late pregnancy".
 "MORPHOGENESIS: THE ANALYSIS OF MOLLUSCAN
 DEVELOPMENT"
 1958
 by Chr. P. Raven Pergamon Press
 311 pp. with 66 figs, and 12 pis. London, New York. Paris,
 Los Angeles.
 Vol. 2 of: "International Series of
 Monographs on pure and applied
 biology, Zoology Division".
 Price: 70 s.
 Monographs devoted to the embryology of one taxonomic group only, illu-
 minated from many different angles, are rare. Nevertheless they form a
23
 necessary supplement to the textbooks conceived on a more general basis. The
 present text centres around the causal analysis of molluscan morphogenesis, a
 field in which the author is one of the leading authorities. Comparative em-
 bryological points of view have not been taken into consideration, while the
 description of normal development has been subordinated to the main purpose
 of the book. As far as experimental embryology and cytochemistry are
 concerned, the author has aimed at giving a complete bibliography, covering
 the last half century.
 The subject matter is organized into a series of chapters, each covering a
 particular developmental period, and each divided into a descriptive part and a
 section dealing with causal analysis. The series is opened by a chapter on
 oogenesis, and closed by a chapter on organogenesis and a short chapter
 summarizing the principal conclusions. The book is concluded by a bibliography,
 and author, taxonomic and subject indexes.
 Every investigator working in this field, and many others, will want to
 possess this volume, but for many the price will be a serious drawback.
 "AN ATLAS OF FETAL AND NEONATAL HISTOLOGY"
 1957
 by Marie A. Valdes-Dapena J. B. Lippincott Cy.
 with a foreword by Edith L. Potter Philadelphia, Montreal
 200 pp. with 238 photomicrographs Price: $ 11.00
 This atlas has been designed in order to bridge a gap in the developmental
 stages covered by human embryology textbooks on the one hand and histology
 textbooks on the other. The period covered is that between about 4 months
 gestation and an age of about 3 years. A knowledge of the constant and
 rapid changes occurring during this period is essential for the interpretation of
 pathological cases.
 There are 12 sections, each dealing with a particular organ system, and each
 preceded by a short introduction furnishing the necessary basic information,
 and concluded by a bibliography. A final section deals with miscellaneous
 organs and tissues.
 The photomicrographs (all black and white) are generally good, but the
 reproductions might have gained in several instances by the use of a finer grid.
 For convenience the case numbers could have been printed in different type.
 Otherwise the lay-out is admirable.
 "LA FONCTION OVARIENNE ET SON EXPLORATION"
 1956
 by R. Vokaer Masson et Cie.
 108 pp. with 54 figs. Paris
 Price: 1100 Fr.
 The author has tried to give, in a limited number of pages, an overall picture
 of the function of the human ovary, which might be of interest to both medical
 practitioners and medical students.
 For the mammalian embryologist there does not seem to be much of direct
 interest in this book. On the other hand it may be useful to have gathered
24
 together in a small volume the recent data on menstruation, ovulation, ovarian
 hormones, histology of the uterine mucosa, vaginal cytology and physiology,
 etc. (as far as the human species is concerned), instead of having to extract
 them from various sources.

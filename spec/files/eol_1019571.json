This is the retention of larval stage characteristics throughout life, so axolotls usually never fully resemble an adult salamander. Unlike other amphibians, most axolotl fail to metamorphose, living permanently in water (3). Although it does develop lungs, the axolotl's most bizarre feature is its retention of its branch-like gills. These are external projections from the neck on each side of the head. Each side has three branches covered with feathery filaments which increase the surface area for gas exchange. The axolotl has a long, slim and darkly coloured body, and short legs, with four digits on the front feet and five digits on the hind feet. Albino individuals have been bred in captivity, but are not known to live in the wild (2).","agents":[{"full_name":"ARKive","homepage":"http://www.arkive.org/","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"fd8d15df909fa2ad0c3bc98cf0e0d760","dataObjectVersionID":25640814,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/StillImage","dataSubtype":"","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.0,"mimeType":"image/jpeg","title":"File:Axolotl ganz.jpg","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","source":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axolotl_ganz.jpg","description":"Axolotl","mediaURL":"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Axolotl_ganz.jpg","eolMediaURL":"http://media.eol.org/content/2013/04/18/22/05862_orig.jpg","eolThumbnailURL":"http://media.eol.org/content/2013/04/18/22/05862_98_68.jpg","agents":[{"full_name":"Lokilech","homepage":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/:de:Benutzer:Kolling","role":"photographer"},{"full_name":"Wikimedia Commons","homepage":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"f19320cce5c48cafb79994670c33e380","dataObjectVersionID":23568900,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/MovingImage","dataSubtype":"","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.5,"mimeType":"video/mp4","title":"young axolotls","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","rightsHolder":"Casey Dunn","source":"http://vimeo.com/13334833","description":"Here is a clip of a few young axolotls.

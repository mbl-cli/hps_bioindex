It is a rather short-tailed, stocky salamander with 13 costal grooves and 5 toes on its hindfeet. Its limbs are also relatively short and its toes do not touch when the fore- and hindlimbs are adpressed to the flank. The overall dorsal color is light brown, liberally \"misted\" with tiny black dots. The ventral surface is light yellowish brown to gray. Both the dorsal and ventral edges of the tail have a bright yellow stripe which may be interrupted toward the tip of the tail. <br></br><i>Hynobius tokyoensis</i> is very similar and was once treated as a subspecies of <i>H. nebulosus</i>.

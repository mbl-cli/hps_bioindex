You may have come across it in a school biology dissection.  It is also a favourite bait worm for anglers.Lumbricus terrestris was first described by Linneus in 1758 and is the largest UK species of earthworm.It is preyed upon by the invasive New Zealand flatworm, which has established itself on the west coast of Scotland and in Northern Ireland.Worms are critical for soil turnover and fertility. They eat dead plant material, and their burrows help aerate the soil and let water through easily. Worm casts (faeces) are rich in recycled plant nutrients that help maintain soil fertility.","agents":[{"full_name":"Dr Dan Carpenter","homepage":"","role":"author"},{"full_name":"Natural History Museum","homepage":"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/species-of-the-day/index.html","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"3f55f2ab65d1a39166cdf0b7c6cfbac5","dataObjectVersionID":22892100,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/StillImage","dataSubtype":"","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":3.25,"mimeType":"image/jpeg","title":"Contracted - close-up","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","audience":["Everyone"],"source":"http://www.bioimages.org.uk/html/p7/p78408.php","description":"Longitude (deg): -1.2.

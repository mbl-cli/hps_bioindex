green anole or Carolina anole (<em><a href=\"/pages/795869\">Anolis carolinensis</a></em>) is common in pet stores where it is sometimes identified as  the American chameleon because of its ability to change color from green to  brown. It is important to note, though, that these lizards are not actually a  type of chameleon. Green anoles are the only anole lizard native to North  America, and are found primarily in the southeastern United   States, with recent introductions to Hawaii,  Guam, and elsewhere. They are very common  throughout their distribution, typically found on the sides of buildings, on  shrubs or vines, and high in trees. They periodically are also found on the  ground. As their name suggests, these lizards are emerald green in color, but  can change to brown. Both males and females have a pink throat fan (a.k.a.  dewlap), which is used as a means for inter- and intraspecific communication.  Their toes are expanded at the tips to accommodate adhesive toe pads, which aid  them in climbing smooth surfaces where claws cannot be used. The reproductive  season takes place during the months of April through July, when the typically  territorial males become even more intensely territorial, attempting to secure  exclusive access to groups of females. Female anole lizards can lay one egg each  week throughout the four-month breeding cycle. The green anole has been a  particularly important organism for study in the scientific community, and has  been successfully used as a model system for studying neurological disorders  and for studying drug delivery systems and biochemical pathways relevant to  human illnesses. They have also been essential for scientific progress in  understanding other aspects of physiology and behavior in animals. The Genus <em>Anolis</em>,  which includes over 350 recognized species, also serves as a group of major  interest for exploring the evolutionary diversification; of particular interest  is the repeated convergent pattern of adaptive radiation on islands of the Greater Antilles, producing on each island essentially  the same set of habitat specialists adapted to use different parts of the  environment.  As a result, in 2005, the  scientific community overwhelmingly chose the green anole lizard as its first  target species for reptilian genome sequencing. In recent years, populations of <em><a href=\"/pages/795869\">A. carolinensis</a></em> have apparently become less common, although no data are  available.  This decline is correlated  with massive habitat alteration and the introduction of the brown anole (<em>Anolis sagrei</em>) from Cuba.   <em><a href=\"/pages/795869\">Anolis carolinensis</a> </em>is derived  from <em>A. porcatus </em>on Cuba,  which coexists with <em><a href=\"/pages/1055784\">A. sagrei</a>.  </em>One  possibility is that the presence of <em>A. sagrei </em>in Florida has caused <em><a href=\"/pages/795869\">A. carolinensis</a> </em>to  return to the more arboreal ecological niche occupied by <em>A. porcatus</em>. </p>","agents":[{"full_name":"S.
